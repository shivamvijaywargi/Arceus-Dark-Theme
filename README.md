### Another Dark theme for VS Code you ask? Here you go

So, now the main purpose of making this theme: I tried a lot of themes available on marketplace and I did not like something or the other in them. So I made this theme as per my liking.

After making it I thought why not publish it to marketplace, maybe someone might find this usefull.

### Note: This theme is made keeping HTML, CSS, JS and TS in mind as I mostly use only these languages only

### If you'd want this theme to work for other languages feel free to make PRs, I'd be more than happy to merge 'em

**Enjoy!**
